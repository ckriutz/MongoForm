## MongoForm

A quick form created in ASP.NET 4.5.1. A simple survey (which can be changed, certainly) that stores the results into a MongoDB. This simple application will show how to Create, Read, and Delete documents.

In order to get the application to work, pull down the repo, and update the connection string to point to your MongoDB. At this moment, security is not built into the mongodb connection, so use this for testing only.
